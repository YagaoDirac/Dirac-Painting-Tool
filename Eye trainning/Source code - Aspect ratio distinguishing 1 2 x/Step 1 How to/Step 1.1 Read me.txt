Open the sln file with visual studio 2017(or 2015 2019). Build it. The compiling ends incorrectly. If you google the error info, you would probably get some useful infomation. I prepared something for you in the file next to this txt. Set up the project properties according to that txt, then build the project again.
If you still encounter any issue, please report it in my discord and wait patiently. Discord address is in this repo.
